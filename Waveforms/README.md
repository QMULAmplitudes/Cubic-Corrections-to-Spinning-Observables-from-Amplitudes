This is the companion repository to "Spinning waveforms in cubic effective field theories of gravity", 2408.XXXXX, where we provide the scalar and spinning waveforms for both G3 and I1 interactions. These correspond to equations (4.21) and (4.30) in the paper. The parity-odd waveforms can be easily obtained from their parity-even counterparts by multiplying by i.

See the file "LoadingWaveforms.nb" for instructions on getting the waveforms. The notation used is quoted in the Mathematica file and here for convenience.

Notation:\
*m1 and m2 are the masses of the two black holes\
*U is the retarded time\
*\[CapitalKappa] = Sqrt[32\[Pi]G]\
*\[Sigma] is the Lorentz factor \[Sigma]:= u1\[CenterDot]u2\
*a1 and a2 are the ring radii of the two black holes\
*u1 and u2 are the velocities of the two black holes\
*k denotes a unit vector in the direction of the radiation, denoted Overscript[k, ^] in the paper\
*\[Epsilon][A,B,C,D] is the 4 dimensional Levi-Civita tensor fully contracted, \[Epsilon]^\[Mu]\[Nu]\[Rho]\[Sigma]Subscript[A,\[Mu]]Subscript[B, \[Nu]]Subscript[C, \[Rho]]Subscript[D, \[Sigma]]\
*ksq[A,B] is the spinor trace [k|A B|k]. Note that X^\[Mu] in the paper corresponds to ksq[v1,\[Mu]]\
